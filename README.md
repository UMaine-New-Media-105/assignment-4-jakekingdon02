README for assignment 4
Due: April 7th, 2023. 

Challange 1: In assignment four challange one, In this sketch, I used a loop to build three radially symmetric star shapes. The loop is inside a custom 
function that can pass parameters that sets the color, number of sides of the shape, etc...

Challange 2: In assignment four challange two, I create a repeat combination of paintdrop shapes horizontally and vertically to create a two-dimensional 
pattern. Instead of using a star, I decided to create a paintdrop pattern instead. Hopefully that won't be a problem. If it is, I can change it for the 
future. Link: https://editor.p5js.org/Jake_Kingdon02/sketches/3zCd9gzcU

Challange 3: In assignment four challange three, I created a function that draws random blue strings across the canvas when the user clicks on the screen. 
I used constants to make the creation of the 50 random placed strings easier and more efficient.

*Reused code from Q2* 

Challange 4: In assignment four challange four, I created a sketch that displays a pattern of sprites on the screen that represent the different gradients 
of the color red, in a set order. Also, the sprites appear all at once as a static image.
